## Introduction

I made the decision to change careers and pursue my passion for Software Development.  Previously, I was an Operations Manager at Clear Channel Outdoor, where i managed a department of six employees and was in charge of day to day installation schedules and in charge of a yearly capital expenditure budget of over a quarter of a million dollars among many other things. I also have another 9 years of experience in Project Management and Structural Design in the construction field.
Currently, I am a student/intern with CNM Ingenuity Deep Dive Coding learning the Java and Android languages and working on a personal Android project and a group Capstone project among other things.  
I would also like to continue learning other languages such as C# and Python.  After the bootcamp, i would like to pursue a career in Software Development for a data science company.
